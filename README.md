# Sudoku-Solver

This solver uses a brute force algorithm for creating a solution for any Sudoku puzzle. The numbers start from 0 until an acceptable number is found. If the number reaches 9 with no solution, the puzzle moves to the last editable number and increase that, searching for another possible solution. This is done until one final solution is found.
